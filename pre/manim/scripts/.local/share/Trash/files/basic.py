# To watch one of these scenes, run the following:
# python --quality m manim -p example_scenes.py SquareToCircle
#
# Use the flag --quality l for a faster rendering at a lower quality.
# Use -s to skip to the end and just save the final frame
# Use the -p to have preview of the animation (or image, if -s was
# used) pop up once done.
# Use -n <number> to skip ahead to the nth animation of a scene.
# Use -r <number> to specify a resolution (for example, -r 1920,1080
# for a 1920x1080 video)
